#Technologies:

It's a Contacts Manager (you don't say?), all done using ASP.NET, C#, MVC, Razor, Java Script, AJAX, SQL and Bootstrap.
The idea is to have a database online with all our contacts like a music library, so everyone can login and view,add and manage contacts.

I've done this because when I was young at school I had done a rubric in Pascal (Yea, the programming language), so I wanted to see how things have changed in the last 10 years.


The next thing to do is to add the accounts, and a home page that permit to login, and then to improve the UI adding the logo,colors and something cool.
