#Technologies:
<ul>
<li><b>ASP.NET, MVC, C#, Razor, jQuery, JavaScript, AJAX, SQL and Bootstrap</b></ul></li>

The idea is to have a database online with all the contacts like a music library, so everyone can login into his own account and manage his contacts.

#Usage:
<ul>
<li><b>The Home Page</b></li>
The home page displays on the top two rows of 3 profile images (contact photo) each.
These contacts are decided by the user to have them really handy. In short words they represent your favorite contacts, and just clicking on one of these will be diplayed the contact details.
After this, we have a search bar and the button that permit to add a new contact.

The search bar permit the user to search into the database any contact by the first name or the last name.
The add button will move the user to a new page with a form where he can fill it with the contacts info that he wants.

After the search bar the user can find the list of the contacts that are in the database.
Each one is displayed with the full name (Fist name + last name), the phone number, the email address and two action-buttons.

The first action button is the Details button (the light blue one) used to display the full contact details. So the user, on clicking on it, will be send to a new page with all the contact details; in this view we have the possibility tho <b>Modify</b> this contact that we have selected. The user can modify the contact by clicking on the <b>Edit</b> button that's displayed under the contact name.

The other in the contacts table is the Delete button (the red one), on clicking on it the system will diplay a pop-up window to let the user confirm that he wants to delete this contact.
