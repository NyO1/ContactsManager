#Technologies:
<ul>
<li><b>ASP.NET, MVC, C#, Razor, jQuery, JavaScript, AJAX, SQL and Bootstrap</b></ul></li>

The idea is to have a database online with all the contacts like a music library, so everyone can login into his own account and manage his contacts.

#Usage:
<ul>
<li><b>The Home Page</b></li>
The home page displays on the top two rows of 3 profile images (contact photo) each.
These contacts are decided by the user to have them really handy. In short words they represent your favorite contacts, and just clicking on one of these will be diplayed the contact details.
After this, we have a search bar and the button that permit to add a new contact.

The search bar permit the user to search into the database any contact by the first name or the last name.
The add button will move the user to a new page with a form where he can fill it with the contacts info that he wants.
